# BetterSOM

A browser extension for https://summer.hackclub.com to add extra features and display some more data (data part coming soon)

## Installation/Usage

Installation:
1. Download the dist folder
2. Go to your browser and find the extensions page
3. Click Add unpacked (or something similar, depends on browser)
4. Select the dist folder you downloaded
5. Done!

For now the Extension only has an export feature, where it exports the devlogs to a markdown file (without images for now).
You can use it by just going onto any project, and clicking the export button that appears!
